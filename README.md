### Configure Hosts File: <br>

First, you need to configure your computer's hosts file to map the subdomains to the localhost (127.0.0.1). You can find the hosts file in different locations depending on your operating system.

Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts <br>
Linux/Mac: /etc/hosts <br>
Add entries for each subdomain:

`127.0.0.1 <techname>.pb.local` <br>
For example `127.0.0.1 lviv.pb.local`
